You can work around this problem by right clicking or Ctrl+clicking on the .pkg file and select "Open" from the context menu. On [imore](http://www.imore.com/how-open-apps-unidentified-developer-os-x-mountain-lion) you can find pictures how to do it and even a second way.

## Building

- Clone this git repository
- Download Apples [Dictionary Development Kit](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/) (The packages is called "Auxiliary Tools for Xcode")
- Copy the "Dictionary Development Kit" somewhere and adjust the Makefile accordingly
- make
- Optional make validate (you need to install jing for that)
- make install


## Caveats

- Only the first entry is displayed in pop-up mode instead of all (e.g. "boken" shows only "beech") but you will see all of them in dictionary.app.


## Thanks to

Philipp Brauner who build an English <-> German dictionary which I have used now for a couple of years. His plugin gave me the idea to build an English <-> Swedish one.
